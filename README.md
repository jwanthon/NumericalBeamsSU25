# NumericalBeamsSU25
Numerical models and analysis for beam vibrations, with the goal of modeling a kalimba and understanding how it works.

## Tuned Beams and Lead In
Includes MATLAB scripts which simulate basic boundary and initial conditions for guitar strings and beams. Solution approaches involve finite difference methods (FDM) and finite element methods (FEM).  
These files include step-by-step descriptions of the solution approach, along with information on specific problems' time-domain solutions and mode shapes over space.
- **GuitarStringsFDM.m** contains FDM modeling of a guitar string.
- **GuitarStringFEM.m** contains FEM modeling of a guitar string.
- **BIBIBeamFDM.m** contains FDM modeling of a built in-built in beam.
- **BIBIBeamFEM.m** contains FEM modeling of a built in-built in beam.
